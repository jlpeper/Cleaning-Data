# Cleaning Data from Cary Spectrometer Instruments

Python Code: DateTime, NumPy, Pandas, and regular expressions.

The provided code (see Cleaning_Cary_Spectrometer_Data notebook) addresses the many issues with the structure of raw Cary data and facilitates the:
1. Automation of Cary data cleaning and visualization, specifically of desired Absorbance vs. Wavelength plots.
2. Extraction of time data for each collected data point (buried in the bottom of the raw cary cav file).

Please see the Cleaning_Cary_Spectrometer_Data notebook for additional details.
